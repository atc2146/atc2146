## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a graduate student at Columbia University. I study in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department, taking courses in machine learning, statistics, and analytics.

## Projects
* [Pysqlgui](https://github.com/atc2146/pysqlgui): A Python package I built that allows you to interface with SQL in Python.  Developed using Python's sqlite3 module, this package allows you to create databases in memory and query them using SQL.  Published on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pysqlgui/).
* [NYC Arrests](https://github.com/atc2146/NYC-Arrests): A data visualization of arrests in NYC created using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alex.chung#!/vizhome/NYPDArrests/Arrests). Data was pulled in Python using the NYC OpenData API.
* [Flowers for Algernon NLP](https://github.com/atc2146/flowers-for-algernon-nlp): An analysis of the book Flowers for Algeron using Natural Language Processing.  Also includes a [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alex.chung#!/vizhome/FlowersforAlgernon-TextAnalysisandNLP/Main) dashboard.
