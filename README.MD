## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, currently a graduate student at Columbia University. I study in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department, taking courses in machine learning, statistics, and analytics.

## Projects
* [Pysqlgui](https://github.com/atc2146/pysqlgui): A python package I built that allows you to interface with SQL in python.  Built upon python's sqlite database implementation, this package allows you to create databases in memory and query them using SQL.
* [NYC Arrests](https://github.com/atc2146/NYC-Arrests): A data visualization of arrests in NYC creating using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alex.chung#!/vizhome/NYPDArrests/Arrests). Data was pulled in python using the NYC OpenData API.
* [Flowers for Algernon NLP](https://github.com/atc2146/flowers-for-algernon-nlp): An analysis of the book Flowers for Algeron using Natural Language Processing.  Also includes a [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alex.chung#!/vizhome/FlowersforAlgernon-TextAnalysisandNLP/Main) dashboard!
